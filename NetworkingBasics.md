## So what is Networking?

From [lexico.com](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/networking):

> The action or process of interacting with others to exchange information and develop professional or social contacts.
> ‘ the skills of networking, bargaining, and negotiation ’

Networking is a way for Developers to reach beyond themselves to find resources in the community. This can be through digital communication or personal communication,
but personal communication has an added bonus of establishing rapport with others, and in many cases - strong friendships and possible employment opportunities.

## Why is Networking important?

Here's a great intro by Marcell Lipp in Dev.to:

## Okay, where can I go in Orlando?

Since Project Codex is pretty heavily based in Orlando, we can definitely help you out.

To start, make sure you create a Meetup account on [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/).

Next, you can search for the term "Tech" and tighten the criteria to be within 50 miles of Orlando, FL.

Another option is to jump over to an already curated list, like the one hosted by Dwayne at [otech.events](https://otech.events/) and then go to the **Groups** tab

Finally, if you just want a quickstart grouping, check these Meetups out:

- [Project Codex: Orlando Junior Developers](https://www.meetup.com/orlando-juniors/)
- [Orlando Developers Group](https://www.meetup.com/OrlandoDevs/)
- [Front End Orlando CodePen](https://www.meetup.com/Front-End-Orlando/)
- [Code For Orlando](https://www.meetup.com/Code-For-Orlando/)
- [The Orlando Python User Group](https://www.meetup.com/OrlandoPython/)
- [OrlandoJS](https://www.meetup.com/OrlandoJS/)
- [ONETUG - Orlando .NET User Group](https://www.meetup.com/ONETUG/)
- [iOS Orlando](https://www.meetup.com/iOS-Orlando/)
- [Central Florida Android Developers Group](https://www.meetup.com/Central-Florida-Android-Developers-Group/)

After you have looked over the list of available Meetups, go start attending them! Make it a goal to meet at least 3 new people at each one. You will find your circle of colleagues will grow tremendously.

Once you meet people in the community, ask to be invited to the OrlandoDevelopers Slack group. You'll need to provide an email address that you want registered,
but this opens a whole new area of opportunities with many channels available in various tech interests.

Keep an eye out for User Group conferences like [SQLSaturdayOrlando](https://www.sqlsaturday.com/), [Orlando Code Camp](https://orlandocodecamp.com/), and [DevFest](https://devfestflorida.org/).
All of these are opportunities for you to network and grow within the community, and often contain not only technical resources, but jobs by way of recruiters and sponsors as well.

## I can't make it to the meetups

That's ok! Many people have family or other life events that keep them from going to Meetups. You can still learn and get to know the community.
Many Meetups are being streamed and recorded to be posted on [otech.events](https://otech.events/) or [Orlando Devs Community Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1WEDaqcQohRZY7B6G7WayA/videos)

One of the Orlando Developer Board Members also runs a monthly webinar viewing that is recorded for future use as well at [Certified Fresh Events](https://cfe.dev/)
