## About Our Project

#### Project Scope

The Coding Boot Camp Pipeline Network seeks to leverage the awesome talents of new and expert coders to build a web based application that will:

1. Help capture important and relevant information about its members work experience, programming knowledge, training, hidden talents and interests.
2. Help connect students with graduates, mentees with mentors, job seekers with hiring managers, and entreprenuers with expert advisers.
3. Help contributors gain valuable experience in the web development cycle (creating, scoping, architecting, coding, collaborating, and promoting) to further enhance their marketability as an prospective employee.
4. Help build confidence in developers (at every point in the journey) by sharpening their competence with real experience and guidance.

## Description

The Coding Boot Camp Pipeline Network will build a web based application that handles a membership-based searchable database in order to foster valuable connections, creativity and collaborations. The application allows users to connect with others for job opportunities, mentoring, and open source collaboration. Users will be able to import their linkedIn profile and expand it into a more comprehensive profile to give members a deeper dive into their work experience, their education, their passions and interest, and their career aspirations.
